## Original Readme
```
Welcome to the EverQuest Tutorial!

This tutorial will introduce you to the basic mechanics of playing EverQuest, such as movement, combat, and spell casting. For more information on the advanced features of EverQuest, please refer to the "eqmanual_supplement.doc", located in your EverQuest folder.

By default, this self-extractor will install the EQTutorial folder in C:\Program Files\EQTutorial.

After the self-extraction process completes, simply double-click the Tutorial.exe application, located in the EQTutorial folder (C:\Program Files\EQTutorial), in order to run the tutorial.

Please note, the EverQuest Tutorial is not compatible with current EverQuest files, be sure NOT to install the EverQuest Tutorial files into your EverQuest folder as this may render the EverQuest game or the Tutorial unplayable.

Enjoy!
